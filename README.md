# Would You Rather

Welcome to the "Would You Rather?" web app! This is a fun game that allows users to choose between two options and encourages them to make tough decisions.

## Description

As a user, you will be able to log in as one of three existing users and start answering questions. You can choose between two options and submit your answer. You can also view questions that you haven't answered yet and see how other users have voted.

In addition to answering questions, you can also post your own questions for other users to answer. The app also features a leaderboard that displays the ranking of users based on the number of questions they have answered and created.

This project is built using:

- ReactJS
- react-router
- react-redux
- Redux Middleware
- redux-thunk
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- HTTP
- REST Architecture
- Git
- Responsive UI
- Asynchronous HTTP Requests

It is designed to help solidify the understanding of React and Redux while also encouraging creativity and expression.

To improve the predictability of the app's state, strict rules have been established for getting, listening, and updating the store. The app also identifies which state should live inside of Redux and which state should live inside of React components.
